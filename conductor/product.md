# Product Definition

## Initial Concept
The project aims to update a brownfield marketing website by integrating content and UX patterns for automotive and AI offerings. This involves evolving the existing site at https://www.bigintelligenceai.com/ with inspiration from https://emaginereality.com/, while maintaining the BIG brand identity. The focus is on improving the scroll experience, mobile-first design, performance, and accessibility, with new content related to Software Defined Vehicles (SDV), AI in software development, vehicle diagnostics, and AI-driven automation/voice AI offerings.

## Current Implementation Overview
The website is a high-performance, single-page marketing site featuring a global "Aurora Borealis" video background that stays fixed while the page scrolls, providing a premium, immersive aesthetic. It is built using a static stack (HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript).

### Core Structure
- **Global Background Video:** Uses `aurora_bg_h264.mp4` for maximum compatibility, with a semi-transparent black overlay (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.52)`). The video layer is non-interactive (`pointer-events: none`) and sits behind the main content.
- **Glassmorphism Integration:** A consistent design language across the site using semi-transparent backgrounds (`var(--color-background)`) and borders (`var(--color-border)`) with `backdrop-filter` on the header, ensuring readability over the dynamic video backdrop.
- **Hero Section:** Features high-impact typography ("Accelerating Innovation through Strategic AI"), primary/secondary CTAs ("Get Started", "Explore Solutions"), and key trust metrics (10+ Years Expertise, Global Tier-1 Clients, AI-First Proven Results). All content sits on transparent sections to reveal the global aurora.
- **About Us:** Highlights the leadership in AI transformation for the automotive industry, focusing on proven reliability and fast deployment.
- **Services:** Showcases strategic AI solutions with a visual composition and a checklist of offerings:
