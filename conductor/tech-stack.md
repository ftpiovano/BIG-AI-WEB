# Technology Stack

## Overview
This project will utilize a minimal, static web stack focused on performance, accessibility, and ease of deployment.

## Core Technologies
*   **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and layout, including responsive design for mobile-first approach.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Optional, for subtle motion, interactive elements, and enhancing user experience without heavy frameworks.

## Key Considerations
*   **Static Site Generation:** Content will be rendered client-side, suitable for hosting on any static web server or CDN.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Emphasis on efficient asset loading, minimal script usage, and optimized images to achieve high Lighthouse scores.
*   **Accessibility (A11y):** Semantic HTML and adherence to WCAG guidelines will be a priority.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Targeting modern browsers, with progressive enhancement for older versions where feasible.
*   **Deployment:** Simple deployment process, potentially involving direct file upload to a web server or integration with a static site hosting service.
