# Product Guidelines

## Brand Voice
The brand voice should be concise, confident, and engineering-first. Communications should convey authority and expertise in complex technical domains.

## Target Audience
Our primary target buyers are automotive OEMs, Tier-1 suppliers, and mobility/EV startups. Content and design should resonate with a highly technical and business-oriented audience.

## Primary Call to Action (CTA)
The main call to action across the site will be "Book a call" or "Start a project". CTAs should be prominent and guide users towards engagement.

## Design Direction
The design will be modern, premium, and foster high-trust. Motion and animations should be subtle to maintain a professional feel and avoid distracting from content. Strong typography and generous whitespace will be used to enhance readability and a clean aesthetic.

Key SEO keywords will revolve around:
- Software Defined Vehicles (SDV)
- Over-The-Air (OTA) updates
- Vehicle diagnostics
- Prognostics & data analytics
